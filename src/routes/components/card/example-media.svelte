    <p class="text-2xl font-bold">Hey! We are Campground.</p>
    <p class="text-foreground-alt">
        Campground is an independent collective where creativity meets code and design.
        We're a small group passionate about developing open-source tools, experimenting with new tech, and growing projects under one shared identity.
        Whether it's a new app, community, or a weekend experiment, every project developed at Campground is fueled by curiosity, collaboration, and s'mores.
